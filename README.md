Simplified breakdown of the coding steps for the Reddit Topics Notification Bot project:
 Setting Up Reddit Access: 
    Create a connection to Reddit using some special codes provided by Reddit. Think of it like getting a key to open Reddit's door.
  Setting Up Email Access:  
      Access to email to send notifications. This is like having an email account and password.
  Deciding What to Watch:
      Pick a subreddit to watch (like a special room on Reddit) and a keyword (like a secret word) you want to look for in posts.
  Watching for New Posts: 
      The program will keep an eye on the chosen subreddit for any new posts. It's like having a friend who tells you whenever something new happens in that room.
  Checking Posts for Your Keyword: 
      When the program sees a new post, it quickly checks if it contains your secret keyword. It's like scanning the title of the post to see if it's something you're interested in.
  Sending a Notification:
      If the keyword is found, the program sends an email to let you know about the new post. It's like sending a message to your email inbox to say, "Hey, there's something you might like in that special room on Reddit!"
  Repeat:
      The program keeps doing these steps over and over, watching for new posts and sending notifications when it finds something interesting.
